# end-to-end-encrypted-chat
This project is a secure, real-time chat application that implements end-to-end encryption to protect user messages from unauthorized access. Built for privacy-focused communication, it ensures that only the sender and receiver can read the contents of messages â€” not even the server can decrypt them.
